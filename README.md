# Cursor-Inspired Developer Tool Landing Page

This project is a **desktop-first landing page** inspired by the design and structure of the Cursor website.  
The primary objective was to recreate the **visual layout, hierarchy, typography, and spacing** as closely as possible using only **HTML and CSS**.

No animations, responsiveness, JavaScript, frameworks, or AI tools were used in this implementation.
